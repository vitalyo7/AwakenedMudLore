# Slums (new edition)
## About

Slums is a street term for a commercial/housing zone outside of the downtown core. Most of the area is composed of decaying concreate remains of the old city, however the coprorations have invested heavily in this area by constrcution indsutrial facilities and a few high story living complexes. People who live here have jobs in the manufcaturing, and general labor, but they are barely scraping by. The area is notorious for high crime, gangs, drugs and occassional arms sales. The only reason why there is any police, security presence is to ensure corporate factories and assets are protected and that the criminal scum do not spill over into other zones.

## Locations

##### Housing Block 3.

Housing Block is a small arcology complex, with 89 floors. Housing Block 3 is what happens when an entire district is crammed into one building. Most of the floors are designated as residential, with lower floors containg some commercials areas and top floors containing "luxury suites". There are social recreation ares in the middle with a school, childcare facilities and a hospital. There are a few security checkpoints on some of the floors, where lone stars try to contain the crime.

##### End of Line

End of Line is a small decker shop in the slums, that has been converted from a once abandoned store front. Most of the gear is legit, but the owners will ocassionally add a "five finger discounted" gear. Most of the wares is decks and accessories as well as some soft. The store has a backroom with a deck shop, but Lambda doesn't allow anyone there unless she knows them. The store is also protected by an security guard, that packs some heat and makes sure both the store and the owner are kept in one piece.
